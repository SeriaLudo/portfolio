This project leverages advanced statistical modelling to predict the success of bank telemarketing campaigns. By employing a range of techniques, including feature selection, data preprocessing, and classification models, the study evaluates both probability-based (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks) and class-based (e.g., naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbours) approaches. The goal is to optimize marketing strategies and improve campaign outcomes through data-driven decision-making.
