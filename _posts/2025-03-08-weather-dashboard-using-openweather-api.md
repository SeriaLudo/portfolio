title: Real-Time Weather Dashboard with Streamlit & OpenWeather API
excerpt: Designed and developed an interactive dashboard using Python and
  Streamlit to fetch and display real-time weather data via the OpenWeather API.
  The app allows users to compare key metrics like temperature, humidity, and
  air quality, with an option to save the results as a CSV file. Git was used
  for version control and collaboration.

This project aimed to combine data engineering and visualization skills to create a user-friendly weather insights tool. Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, the app fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeather API** based on user-inputted cities or locations. Users can view and compare key weather indicators, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air quality.

To enhance usability, I implemented an optional CSV export feature that enables users to save and track weather data over time. The application is fully interactive, responsive, and well-suited for casual users and data enthusiasts. Throughout the development process, I utilized **Git** for version control, ensuring clean code management and facilitating potential collaboration.
